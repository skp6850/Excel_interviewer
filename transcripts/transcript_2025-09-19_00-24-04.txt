--- Final Evaluation ---
The candidate demonstrated a good understanding of basic Excel functions like AutoSum and AVERAGE, showcasing a solid foundational knowledge.  However, a significant weakness was revealed by their inability to recall the purpose of the COUNTIF function, highlighting a gap in their knowledge of core formulas.  To improve, the candidate should review fundamental Excel functions and practice applying them in diverse scenarios;  I recommend offering conditional employment pending successful completion of a short Excel skills assessment.
